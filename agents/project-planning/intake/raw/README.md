# Raw Requirement Drop Zone

Use this folder for unstructured briefs gathered from interviews, support logs, or earlier chatbot sessions. Keep each submission in English and save it as `<timestamp>-<subject>.md` (for example `20250220-party-generator.md`).

## Processing Flow
- Product owner reviews the raw note, highlights open questions, and extracts a structured spec in `../specs/` using the latest template.
- Leave traceable breadcrumbs: link the resulting spec file at the top of the raw note and add a status section (`Draft`, `In Review`, `Spec Ready`).
- Archive once the structured spec is published and the work moves into the backlog.

Avoid editing the original brief beyond light formattingâ€”add annotations under an `## PO Notes` heading so the original context stays intact.
