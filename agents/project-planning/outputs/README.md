# Outputs

Finalised artefacts ready for the wider team live here. Keep them tidy; these act as the canonical backlog and planning references until imported into another system.

- `backlog/`: Accepted user stories, epics, and acceptance criteria grouped per spec or product area.
- `plans/`: Sprint, release, or roadmap plans scoped for delivery.

Within each folder adopt subdirectories or numbering that matches your team conventions (e.g. `backlog/<product>/story-001.md`). Avoid editing files inside `runs/` after publishing; copy or move the curated version here instead.
