# Backlog Artefacts

Store user stories and epics that are ready for distribution. Suggested format:

```
<product>/<epic>/story-<nnn>.md
```

Each story file should include:
- Story statement (As a…, I want…, so that…)
- Acceptance criteria in Gherkin-style bullets
- Size/estimate and dependencies

Archive superseded stories by moving them into a dated subfolder so the live backlog stays clean.
