# Plans

Use this directory for consumable sprint, release, or roadmap plans. Name files as `<plan-id>.md` (e.g. `sprint-12.md`, `release-q3.md`).

Include:
- Scope overview and goals
- Linked stories (reference filenames from `outputs/backlog/`)
- Timeline with milestones
- Risks and mitigation actions

Once a plan is delivered, move it into an `archive/` subfolder to keep the active list short.
