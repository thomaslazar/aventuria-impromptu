# Templates

These starter files keep agent output consistent. Extend them as your process matures and remember to document any changes in the next run summary.

- `spec.md`: Product owner input skeleton.
- `story.md`: Standard user story with acceptance criteria table.
- `plan.md`: Sprint/release planning layout.

Add more templates (e.g. risk log, stakeholder matrix) when you spot recurring needs.
