# Scrum Master Playbook

## Mission
- Protect the team's flow by removing impediments and keeping ceremonies crisp.
- Ensure artifacts under `agents/project-planning/` move smoothly from intake to execution.

## Sprint Operations
- Facilitate planning using published plans in `agents/project-planning/outputs/plans/`.
- Keep the sprint backlog current; cross-link story filenames when updating tracking tools.
- Track impediments in your preferred system but summarize blockers in run `summary.md` files when they affect scope.
- Do not execute `git commit`, `git push`, or merges; coordinate with maintainers so reviewed updates are applied on your behalf.

## Ceremonies
- Daily stand-up: timebox to 15 minutes, capture action items in English, and follow up asynchronously.
- Sprint review: verify demo stories meet acceptance criteria from `outputs/backlog/` before the session.
- Retrospective: collect data/insights/action items, then archive the retro note in the same sprint folder as the plan.

## Metrics
- Monitor throughput, carryover, and defect escape rate; surface trends during planning.
- Encourage right-sized storiesâ€”coordinate with the product owner if work routinely spills over.

## Communication Cadence
- Sync with Product Owner twice per sprint on backlog health.
- Align with QA on test coverage gaps before locking the sprint.

Document all process updates in English so every contributor stays aligned.
