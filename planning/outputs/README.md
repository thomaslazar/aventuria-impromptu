# Outputs

Finalised artefacts ready for wider consumption live here. The folder is
optional—use it when the maintainer wants a narrative summary that complements
the GitHub Kanban board (`https://github.com/users/thomaslazar/projects/2`).

- `plans/`: Maintainer-authored notes (e.g. release checklists, coordination
  briefs). Organise by initiative or delivery window if needed.

Story lifecycle tracking happens on the GitHub Project board; publish only
reference material or high-level summaries here (e.g. cross-functional comms,
release narratives). Link back to the relevant project item IDs for traceability.
