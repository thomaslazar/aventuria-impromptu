# Outputs

Finalised artefacts ready for wider consumption live here. The folder is
optionalâ€”use it when the maintainer wants a narrative summary that complements
the work-item pipeline.

- `plans/`: Maintainer-authored notes (e.g. release checklists, coordination
  briefs). Organise by initiative or delivery window if needed.

Story lifecycle tracking happens under `work-items/`; publish only reference
material or high-level summaries here.
