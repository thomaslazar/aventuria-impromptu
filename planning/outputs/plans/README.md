# Plans

Use this directory for optional maintainer summaries (release notes, coordination briefs, etc.). Name files descriptivelyâ€”include an ISO timestamp when documenting time-bound plans (e.g. `2025-03-01T10-00-00-release-window.md`).

Suggested sections:
- Scope overview and goals
- Linked stories (reference filenames from `planning/work-items/`)
- Timeline or checklist
- Risks and mitigation actions

Archive superseded plans in a dated subfolder to keep the active list short.
