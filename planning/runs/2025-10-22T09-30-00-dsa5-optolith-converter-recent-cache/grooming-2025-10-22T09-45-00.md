# Grooming Notes — 2025-10-22 Recent Cache UX
Participants:
- Facilitator (Scrum Master or maintainer)
- Product Owner (scope)
- Developer A (frontend)
- Developer B (platform)
- QA Agent (testing)

Backlog Under Review:
- DSA5-OPT-006 — Cache controller for last 10 conversions
- DSA5-OPT-007 — Recent conversions UI interactions

Rounds:
1. Product Owner: Confirmed browser-only storage requirement and clarified that pinning is out of scope.
2. Developer A: Requested explicit warning summary shape (counts + severity) so UI can render badges without deep parsing.
3. Developer B: Highlighted need for cache schema versioning and graceful pruning when structure changes.
4. QA Agent: Asked for deterministic way to reset cache for testing; agreed on “Clear history” UI and developer shortcut.
5. Maintainer: Emphasized accessibility—keyboard navigation, focus management when loading prior conversion, and disabled-state messaging when storage unavailable.

Action Items:
- Developer B – Document warning summary interface (counts + categorized severities) alongside cache controller implementation.
- QA Agent – Draft manual test checklist covering cache availability, disabled state, and clear-history flow prior to story sign-off.

Follow-Up:
- Revisit after controller implementation to confirm UI wiring uses finalized warning metadata payload.
