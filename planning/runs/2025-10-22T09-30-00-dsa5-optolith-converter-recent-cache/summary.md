# Run 2025-10-22T09-30-00-dsa5-optolith-converter-recent-cache

## Context
- Spec: `planning/intake/specs/dsa5-optolith-converter-recent-cache.md`
- Work items: `planning/work-items/new/dsa5-optolith-converter-recent-cache/`

## Objectives
- Groom the recent conversions cache feature to confirm scope, dependencies, and ready status.

## Outcomes
- Validated the cache controller story (DSA5-OPT-006) with clear storage boundaries and migration approach.
- Confirmed the UI story (DSA5-OPT-007) needs explicit disabled-state messaging and accessibility coverage.
- Both stories marked ready for backlog; noted shared dependency on warning metadata shape.

## Follow-Ups
- Developer to align on warning summary payload structure (counts + severity) across controller and UI during implementation.
