# Grooming Notes — 2025-10-22 Optolith Equipment Plan
Participants:
- Facilitator (maintainer)
- Product Owner
- Developer A (parser/resolver)
- Developer B (export/UI)
- QA Agent

Backlog Under Review:
- Spec `planning/intake/specs/optolith-equipment-extraction.md`

Discussion Highlights:
1. Product Owner: confirmed full equipment fidelity is required before next adventure import; no appetite for manual edits post-conversion.
2. Developer A: highlighted need for robust regex + tokenizer updates to extract weapon lines without colliding with narrative text; proposed staged implementation (parser first).
3. Developer B: noted exporter must align with existing Optolith schema (referencing Deidre/Goswin/Nyrociel) and ensure cache schema bump does not break existing users.
4. QA Agent: requested dedicated sample coverage (Tauchspeer, Blasrohr, Haumesser, Waffenlos, RS/BE cases) and explicit manual checklist once implementation lands.
5. Maintainer: agreed to clear history automatically when schema version changes to avoid stale caches; flagged open question about UI surfacing of equipment for validation.

Action Items:
- Slice work into separate stories for parser model updates, resolver mapping, exporter/cache integration, and optional UI exposure.
- Prepare warning localization strings (DE/EN) before implementation stories move to “to-do”.
- QA to draft acceptance checklist targeting equipment mapping once stories are ready for test.
