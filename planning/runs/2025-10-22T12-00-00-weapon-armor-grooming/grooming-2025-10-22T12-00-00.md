# Grooming Notes — 2025-10-22 Optolith Equipment Stories
Participants:
- Facilitator (maintainer)
- Product Owner
- Developer A (parser/resolver)
- Developer B (export/cache/UI)
- QA Agent

Backlog Items Reviewed:
- `planning/work-items/new/optolith-equipment-extraction/story-parser-equipment.md`
- `planning/work-items/new/optolith-equipment-extraction/story-resolver-equipment.md`
- `planning/work-items/new/optolith-equipment-extraction/story-exporter-cache-ui.md`

Discussion Highlights:
1. Product Owner: reiterated accuracy expectations and confirmed staged delivery (parser → resolver → exporter) is acceptable if each stage leaves the converter functional.
2. Developer A: requested explicit TypeScript interface updates for weapons/armor and agreed to own parser story with comprehensive Vitest coverage.
3. Developer B: stressed need to bump cache schema carefully; suggested writing migration helper to clear history with user-friendly warning message.
4. QA Agent: flagged requirement to run manual checks on representative samples (Tauchspeer, Blasrohr, Haumesser, Waffenlos, armor RS/BE variation) and to verify warning counts in both live result and cached history.
5. Maintainer: confirmed all stories will include localization updates and emphasized resolving warning deduplication within resolver/exporter to avoid regressions.

Action Items:
- Developer A to split parser acceptance checklist into subtasks (weapon parsing, armor parsing, multi-line handling) before starting implementation.
- Developer B to draft cache schema migration notes and coordinate with QA on validation steps for history clearing.
- QA to prepare manual regression checklist covering equipment scenarios once stories move to `in-progress`.
