# Legacy Work Item Pipeline

The authoritative backlog now lives on the GitHub Kanban project
`https://github.com/users/thomaslazar/projects/2`. This directory is retained
only for historical context (older markdown stories and gitkeep placeholders).
Do **not** add new items here.

Refer to `../PLAYBOOK.md` for the GitHub Project workflow, status option IDs,
and CLI commands. When you discover older files under these folders, migrate the
content into the GitHub project (e.g. paste the markdown into a draft item) and
remove the file to avoid divergence.
